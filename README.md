# 52465---Programming-for-Data-Analysis---Project
This reposotory contains the files relevant to the Programming for Data Analysis Project conducted by Aidan O'Connor G00364756.

To run the project please fork the repository to a folder onyour computer and run jupyter notebook (you may need to install the jupyter notebook software if you haven't already) through your command line interface. Select the folder you forked the repository to and select the .ipynb file within the folder. The .ipynb file is titled "AOC_G00364756_52465---Programming for Data Analysis---Project 2018.ipynb".
An alternative to this is to run the notebook through the jupyter notebook viewer on the jupyter.org website (https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). You can copy the URL link of the jupyter notebook repository in Github and paste this link into the jupyter notebook viewer. The viewer should display the notebook but please note that sometimes the jupyter notebook can run into problems, so you may need to use the first method.

All other files (i.e. not .ipynb files) contained within this repository are suplimentary to the .ipynb file and if the jupyter notebook is run correctly, these files hsould be represented within the notebook.
